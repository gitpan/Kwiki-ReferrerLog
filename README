DESCRIPTION
    This module logs all referers coming from external sites to your Kwiki
    wiki, and displays them in a convenient, stylable table. That's all.
    It's very basic but you can easily redefine/change most of the
    functionality by overriding the appropriate methods (see below).

OPTIONS
    The following configurationoptions can be overriden in your config.yaml
    file:

    "keep_days"
         This determines after which number of days, a log entry gets
        deleted from the store, if there weren't any requests coming in from that
        URL. Don't set this value too high. (default is: 2)

    "date_format"
         The date format that is used in the display of logged referrers.
        This is directly passed to the L<strftime> function of the L<POSIX> package,
        so don't hate me, if you specify a wrong pattern (default is: %d.%m.%Y %H:%M)

    "exclude_referrers"
         This is a list of domains, that won't be logged as
        referrers. You should set this at least to the domain your Kwiki installation is
        running on, so the clicking around on your wiki won't result in a flood of
        referrers showing up in you referrer log.
        The list must be in a YAML anonymous array format, that looks like this:

exclude_referrers:
- example.com
- site.org

    "exclude_subdomains"
        This boolean value specifies (0 is false, everything else is true),
        is subdomains of the configured exclude_referrers domains should be
        exluded too, or if they should be logged. Example: If
        exclude_referrers is set to exclude the domain example.com, then
        requests coming from sample.example.com will be logged if
        exclude_subdomains is set to 0, while they won't be logged when
        exclude_subdomains is set to 1. (default value: 1)

    "truncate_referrers"
         This number defines, after how much characters the referring
        address should be truncated in the ReferrerLog Display (default value: 40).

METHODS
    The behaviour of the Kwiki::ReferrerLog module can be changed quite
    easily. Simply stuff the module in your @ISA array (or use it as a base
    class) and override selected methods. The module provides the following
    methods, which can be overridden:

    "show_referrerlog()"
        This method loads the stored referrers and renders the template for
        showing the result back to the browser. It is registered as the
        action-method for this module.

    "log_referrer"
        This method logs the referrer. For this it checks if the referrer
        comes from an external site. If this is not the case, the control
        flow leaves the method. Otherwise the stored referrers are loaded
        and the current one is appended to the list. Afterwards it checks,
        if some of the referrers are older than the configured value for
        keep_days. If this is the case, the corresponding referrers are
        deleted from the list.

    "file_path"
        This method returns a relative path to the location of the referrer
        log file (default: plugin_directory/referrerlog/referrers.log).

    "load_log"
        This method loads the stored referrer entries and returns them as an
        hash reference, that contains, keyed by referring URLs, array
        references.

        The following example should clarify the structure:

    "store_log"
        This method takes a hash reference as described above and stores it,
        so that the load_log method can retrieve it later.

    "date_fmt"
        This method uses the date_format configuration option, to format the
        timestamp that is passed as the first and only parameter, as the
        user/admin wishes.

    "delete_old_logs"
        This method is called before every call to store_log, and deletes
        entries, that are older than the number of days specified by the
        keep_days option (see above).
